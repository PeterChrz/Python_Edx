# Key Lessons

## Iterative Algorithms
- Guess and check methods build on reusing the same code, through a looping construct to generate guesses then check and continue.

- Generating Guesses
    - Exhaustive enumeration
    - Bisection search
    - Newton-Raphson (root finding)

## Abstration and Deconstruction
